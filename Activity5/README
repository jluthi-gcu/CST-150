Exception Handling

FileName: frmMain.cs
LineNumber: 49
Description: I added a simple try catch satement over the main body of code that handles file selection, processing, and outputing of the stats. If anything fails I threw the exception so the user would see the detail. My code uses a lot of if statements for safe checking so ideally an exception should be very rare. 

- I hope this was adequate but if not would appreciate feedback for the future so I can adjust.
